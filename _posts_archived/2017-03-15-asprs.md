Today, I presented my camera ready poster at the [ASPRS 2017 conference](conferences.asprs.org/Baltimore-2017/). The conference was held in the Baltimore, MD, USA. The venue was Marriott hotel water front with a spectacular view of Patapsco river. There were so many talks from the leading icons in the Geospatial industry including Jack Dangermond from ESRI and Patrick Meier from [WeRobotics](http://werobotics.org/speaking-tedxberlin). In addition, several exhibitors from leading Geospatial tech companies including Google (with their [Google earth engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)) were demonstrating their state of art technology and software.

Meeting old friends and reviewing old memories are always fun. It was very unexpected yet intriguing to meet two of my undergrad friends (Mohammad Rezaei and Fatemeh Fatolahi) after 6 years.
