Yesterday, I was guest speaker and I gave a talk on the advance programming concepts in the R environment. The class comprised of PhD students in behavioral ecology. We talked about various aspects of R programming and showed a few tricks to make the life of a R developer easier and to improve the performance of R code. You can find the lecture file [here](http://www.fcheraghi.ir/uploads/adv-r-prog.pdf). Later on, I will also upload the lab material.
